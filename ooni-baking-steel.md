## Log

### 25/12/24
- Used the quick pizza dough recipie from my notes, but added more yeast and had it in the fridge for most of the fermentation.
- Caputto flour
- 1 hour bulk ferment fridge. Ball and 6 hours ferment balled in fridge. Take out 2 hours
- Balls were too small (180 gr) try 240 next
- Used convection and heat from top and bottom (no grill), pizzas well cooked on top, bottom could be more cooked.
- Too much flour under the pizza
- Better with fresh mozzarella than with grated one, but should cut it very thin.

### 29/12/24
- Caputto flour, 65% water, 0.6% fresh yeast, 3% salt, 230gr balls.
- 2 hour bulk fermentation, ball and 24 hour fridge. Take out 2 hour before baking
- First pizzas baked with convection top/bottom heat on the middle up level.
- Last pizzas no convection on the middle down level.
- Last pizas baked better on the bottom, the first ones were getting burned on the top before the bottom was brown
