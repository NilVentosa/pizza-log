## Log

### 25/12/24
- Used the quick pizza dough recipie from my notes, but added more yeast and had it in the fridge for most of the fermentation.
- Caputto flour
- 1 hour bulk ferment fridge. Ball and 6 hours ferment balled in fridge. Take out 2 hours
- Balls were too small (180 gr) try 240 next
- Used convection and heat from top and bottom (no grill), pizzas well cooked on top, bottom could be more cooked.
- Too much flour under the pizza
- Better with fresh mozzarella than with grated one, but should cut it very thin.

### 29/12/24
- Caputto flour, 65% water, 0.6% fresh yeast, 3% salt, 230gr balls.
- 2 hour bulk fermentation, ball and 24 hour fridge. Take out 2 hour before baking
- First pizzas baked with convection top/bottom heat on the middle up level.
- Last pizzas no convection on the middle down level.
- Last pizas baked better on the bottom, the first ones were getting burned on the top before the bottom was brown

### 03/01/25
- Caputto flour, 65% water, 0.6% fresh yeast, 3% salt, 240gr balls.
- 2 hour bulk fermentation, ball and 24 hour fridge. Take out 3 hour before baking
- Heated the steel on the top rack with grill then moved to bottom rack with bottom heat no convection
- First pizza took a long time to bake on top, then I turned fan on (only bottom element heating) and they baked better
- One pizza with dry mozarella, no tomato and with semolina was the best of the day, semolina gives nicer crunch to the dough but is not so nice to work with.
- Third pizza was baked with tomato only and cheese was added later, this feels good but it was still a bit too early
